# TrainThreads
"TrainThreads" is a Java application designed to manage trains made up of locomotives and wagons, with the goal of demonstrating multithreading in Java. The application includes methods to create trains, add wagons to them, and move the trains between start and end stations.

The project showcases various methods and fields for controlling train movement, such as those for adding or removing wagons, controlling train speed and percentage of completed path, and fields for storing information about the types and quantities of wagons.

The application is designed to provide a practical example for studying object-oriented programming concepts in Java, such as classes and objects, while also demonstrating multithreading concepts.

Overall, "TrainThreads" is a small yet interesting project that can be used to understand the basics of managing trains in a multithreaded environment, making it an ideal learning tool for beginners and intermediate-level Java developers alike.
